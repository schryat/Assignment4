        The Flaming Lips: The Soft Bulletin
      </h1>
      <p>
        In 1999, a psychedelic rock band from Oklahoma known as The Flaming Lips released an album that many consider to be their magnum opus, “The Soft Bulletin”.
        I have listened to the album many times, and now understand why many fans and critics hold this opinion.
        The album starts off strong with the opener “Race for the Prize,” a song whose lyrics revolve around a race for a cure, and coincidentally mirror the pandemic of today.
        It has blaring horn like synths and an overall positive and hopeful sound to it. The album has many cheery songs like this such as the next track, “A Spoonful Weighs a Ton” and the later track, “Buggin”.
        However, songs like this only create a sound that makes up half of the album. Most of the others have a sad sound, and have very deep lyrics about life.
        “The Spiderbite Song,” tells the story of when a band member had an infected injection from heroin use, but didn’t want to admit it, so he passed it off as a spider bite.
        Or the closing track, “Feeling Yourself Disintegrate,” which tells about how everyone is slowly disintegrating, a metaphor for aging, and how we should all enjoy life.
        It's this dynamic between happy and sad that makes the album so special. The messages within the songs, and all the emotions they portray, are really what gives the album its charm. 
        <br><b>Final Rating:</b> 9/10.
